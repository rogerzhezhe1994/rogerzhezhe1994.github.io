I have been working as researcher/engineer in the field of hyper-scale cloud computing and networking infrastructures, with a focus to design and optimize data center networking performance. Prior, I obtained Ph.D in Electrical Engineering from University of Southern California in 2022, advised by [Prof. Alan E. Willner](https://ee.usc.edu/~willner/). Before joining USC, I completed my B.Eng in Information Engineering from Zhejiang University in 2016. I have solid technical background in digital signal processing, signal and system, communications, and machine learning. Moreover, I have broad interest in AI/ML infrastructure, cloud computing, and computer networking.
