I am an optical network engineer in Amazon Web Services (AWS), responsible for metrics design, monitoring, and optimization of AWS super-large-scale cloud computing and networking infrastructure. Previously, I obtained Ph.D in Electrical Engineering from University of Southern California (USC) in 2022, with a research interest in digital signal processing, signal and system, communications, and machine learning. Before joining USC, I completed my B.Eng in Information Engineering from Zhejiang University, where I was selected to Advanced Honor Class of Engineering Education Program (ACEE) in ChuKochen Honors College (top 2% selected among all engineering students).
