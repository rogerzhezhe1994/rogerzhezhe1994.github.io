I have been working as an engineer/researcher in hyper-scale cloud networking infrastructures (Meta and AWS), with a focus to design and optimize data-center and backbone networking performance. Prior, I obtained Ph.D in Electrical Engineering from University of Southern California in 2022, advised by [Prof. Alan E. Willner](https://ee.usc.edu/~willner/). Before joining USC, I completed my B.Eng in Information Engineering from Zhejiang University in 2016. I have solid technical background in digital signal processing, photonics, signal & system, and communications & networking. Moreover, I have broad interest in cloud computing, computer networking, and AI infrastructure.
